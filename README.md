This repository will serve to hold my "Special Topics in GIS" project.  This project will focus on creating web based maps
 for Hall Area Transit in order to display public transit information more clearly.  This project will also demonstrate the 
 benefit of utilizing GIS tools and skill sets on existing public infrastructure.
